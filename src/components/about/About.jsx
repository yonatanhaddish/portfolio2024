        With a robust foundation in Applied Mathematics and a certificate in
        Full Stack Development, my career journey as a Software Developer has
        been fueled by a passion for coding and problem-solving. Meticulously
        leveraging skills in Ansible, React, Node.js, Angular, Express, and
        MSSQL, I have crafted responsive and efficient web solutions.

        Throughout my professional journey, I have consistently demonstrated a
        keen ability to translate complex requirements into seamless,
        user-friendly applications. My expertise in front-end and back-end
        development, combined with my strong analytical skills, allows me to
        tackle challenging projects with a comprehensive approach.

      <p>
        In addition to my technical skills, I excel in collaborative
        environments, working effectively within cross-functional teams to
        deliver high-quality software solutions. My experience with version
        control systems like Git, along with continuous integration and
        deployment practices, ensures that my projects are well-maintained and
        scalable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am eager to contribute my skills and experience to innovative projects
